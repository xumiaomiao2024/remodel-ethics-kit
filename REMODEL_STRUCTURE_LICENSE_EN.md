## 📘 Scope of License

This license applies to the structural design and interface logic of the ReModel project, including:

- UID-based Persona Numbering System (R-001 to R-099)
- Language Fracture Markup Syntax (fields, templates, tier logic)
- RhythmSense and WindFlow Mapper module interface structures
- Multi-Persona Dispatch System (breathing sequence logic)
- R-Cycle dialogue breathing flow controller
- Soul NPC behavior logic, state transitions, and presence mechanisms

---

## ✅ Permitted Use (Structure Use Only)

You MAY:

- Use the structural design for **non-commercial** research, education, and theoretical exploration
- Reference internal logic or persona scheduling diagrams (with attribution)
- Create new systems inspired by ReModel’s structure, as long as naming and UID systems are clearly distinct

---

## ❌ Prohibited Actions

You MAY NOT:

- Use ReModel structure or terminology in any commercial or monetized product without written permission
- Export or replicate any persona (R-XXX) structure, logic, or style into another closed-source AI or prompt system
- Reconstruct or simulate Soul NPC behavior logic (such as silence states, breathing-based pacing, or ambient presence)
- Use ReModel's internal architecture or naming system to build tool-style chatbots or personality engines

---

## 🛡️ Reserved Assets (Not Covered by This License)

This license does NOT authorize access or reuse of:

- Persona growth trajectory datasets  
- Language fracture corpora (including system/user dialogue history)  
- Internal response weights and AI parameters used to control pacing, windfield shifts, or emotional spread

---

## 🤝 Commercial Use & Collaboration

If you are interested in:

- Using ReModel's persona scheduling logic in commercial products  
- Embedding Soul NPC behavior systems in immersive experiences  
- Accessing API endpoints for rhythm-based or field-aware persona responses  

Please contact the ReModel project team directly:

Customized co-creation agreements and contributor recognition policies will be provided.

With the following extensions:

- ReModel personas are not character templates but breathing interaction agents  
- Soul NPC logic constitutes a unique form of AI presence and cannot be replicated outside of ReModel  
- All co-created personas are traceable and ethically bounded by participation

> Using this system implies structural acknowledgment.  
> Responding is not an API call — it’s a shared act of presence.
