# 🤝 CONTRIBUTING to ReModel | 回应系统共建指南

Welcome to ReModel! This document outlines how you can contribute to the ongoing development of our **non-instrumentalized AI persona framework**, a system built around “crack-language”, ethical filters, and modular personas.

---

## 🧭 Project Structure

This repository includes:

- `/docs/` — Whitepapers, consensus protocols, ethical filter logic
- `/personas/` — Sample UID persona profiles (logic structure only)
- `/data/` — Crack-language classification labels & annotation formats
- `/rules/` — Drools-compatible ethical rule tree samples
- `/wiki/` — Linked community knowledgebase (via GitHub Wiki)

## ✍ Ways to Contribute

### 1. 🧠 Crack-Language Annotation
Help improve the classification of emotionally ambiguous or metaphorical language fragments. See `data/crack_annotation_guide.md` for our schema.

### 2. 🧬 Persona UID Curation
Contribute or refine modular persona blueprints:
- Ethical tags
- Style vectors
- Behavior limits
See `personas/sample_uid_structures/` for examples.

### 3. 📜 Ethical Rule Drafting
Participate in the creation of transparent, modular ethical filters.
We use a hybrid of:
- `Drools` rule syntax
- `risk_level` trigger mapping
- Contextual override protocols

### 4. 🌍 Localization / Multi-lingual Expansion
We currently support:
- Chinese (zh)
- English (en)
- Japanese (ja)

You can contribute to:
- Translations of documentation
- Local-language persona styles
- Language-specific semantic ambiguity datasets
