# ðŸ§  ReModel Ethics Kit | AI Persona Governance Toolset

**An open-source ethical governance toolkit for persona-based AI interaction systems, compatible with DeepSeek API.**  
Developed by the ReModel Project Â· Currently maintained by a solo researcher.

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

This repository contains core components from the ReModel system, designed to enable traceable, ethically accountable responses in AI systems built on LLMs such as DeepSeek.

Key features include:
- Signature tracing across multi-persona responses  
- Emotion + intent based crack-language trigger framework  
- Rule-based ethical risk filtering (Drools-compatible logic)  
- Sample response signature and risk annotation protocols

| `docs/ethics-schema-description.md` | Explains ethical rule hierarchy and judgment fields |
| `examples/crack-language-trigger-demo.md` | Sample of persona switching triggered by complex emotional metaphors |
| `scripts/signature_protocol.py` | Simple hash-based tracing method for response identity |

## ðŸ”— DeepSeek Compatibility

This toolkit is built through real-world integration tests with DeepSeek v1â€“v2.3 public API structure.  
Supported fields:

- `intent_class` + `risk_level` for ethical rule triggers  
- Persona invocation mapping based on API results  
- Optional embedding of `response_signature`: `uid + path + ethical_hash`
